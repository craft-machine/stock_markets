## Usage

To interact with markets data use class `StockMarkets::Markets`. This class provides `Enumerable` on class level.
Examples of using:

```ruby
# To get information about markets as hash, where key - MIC of market, value - market data
StockMarkets::Markets.table #=>  {"AIXK"=>{:continent=>"Asia", :country=>"Kazakhstan ", :name=>"....} }

# Some markets can be without mic in data source, that's why if you want get some additional information, you can use table_for_names
StockMarkets::Markets.table_for_names #=> { "TEMATIC INTERNALISER"=>{:country=>"FRANCE", :iso_country_code_iso_3166=>"FR", :mic=>"SGOE", ...} }

# To get information about markets as array(array of data for all markets)
StockMarkets::Markets.data_list #=> [{:continent=>"Asia", :country=>"Kazakhstan ", :name=>"Astana Internat..."}]

# Also you can iterate over markets with help of Enumerable module:
StockMarkets::Markets.map do |market|
  market[:country]
end
#=> ["GERMANY", "SWEDEN", ...]
```
